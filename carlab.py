PROGRAM NO -1
OBJECTIVE:
Demonstration of Hardware peripherals: CPU, RAM, SMPS, Motherboard, NIC card, Processor, 
Processor cooling fan, PCI card, HDD
DESCRIPTION: 
CPU/processor
 The central processing unit (CPU), also called a processor, is located inside 
the computer case on the motherboard. It is sometimes called the brain of the computer, 
and its job is to carry out commands. Whenever you press a key, click the mouse, or start 
an application, you're sending instructions to the CPU.
 The CPU is usually a two-inch ceramic square with a silicon chip located inside. The 
chip is usually about the size of a thumbnail. The CPU fits into the motherboard's CPU 
socket, which is covered by the heat sink, an object that absorbs heat from the CPU.
 A processor's speed is measured in megahertz (MHz), or millions of instructions per 
second; and gigahertz (GHz), or billions of instructions per second. A faster processor 
can execute instructions more quickly. However, the actual speed of the computer 
depends on the speed of many different components—not just the processor.

RAM (random access memory)
 RAM is your system's short-term memory. Whenever your computer performs 
calculations, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until it is needed.
 This short-term memory disappears when the computer is turned off. If you're working 
on a document, spreadsheet, or other type of file, you'll need to save it to avoid losing it. 
When you save a file, the data is written to the hard drive, which acts as long-term 
storage.
 RAM is measured in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB). The more RAM you have, 
the more things your computer can do at the same time. If you don't have enough RAM, 
you may notice that your computer is sluggish when you have several programs open. 
Because of this, many people add extra RAM to their computers to improve 
performance.
 Types of RAM:
 SRAM(Static RAM)
 DRAM(Dynamic RAM)
SMPS
 The full form of SMPS is Switched Mode Power Supply also known as Switching 
Mode Power Supply. 
 SMPS is an electronic power supply system that makes use of a switching regulator to 
transfer electrical power effectively.
Acharya Institute of Graduate Studies Department of Computer Application
Computer Assembly and Repair Lab 3
 It is a PSU (power supply unit) and is usually used in computers to change the voltage to 
the appropriate range for the computer.
 An SMPS adjusts output voltage and current between different electrical configurations 
by switching the basics of typically lossless storage such as capacitors and inductors.
Motherboard
 A motherboard provides connectivity between the hardware components of a computer, 
like the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), Hard Drive and Vedio Card. There are 
multiple types of motherboards, designed to fit different types and sizes of computers.
 Each type of motherboard is designed to work with specific types of processors and 
memory, so they don't work with every processor and type of memory. However, hard 
drives are mostly universal and work with most motherboards, regardless of the type or 
brand.
NIC(network interface card)
 A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware component without which a computer 
cannot be connected over a network. 
 It is a circuit board installed in a computer that provides a dedicated network connection 
to the computer. 
 It is also called network interface controller, network adapter or LAN adapter.
 NIC allows both wired and wireless communications.

Computer Assembly and Repair Lab 4
Types of NIC Cards
NIC cards are of two types −
Internal Network Card
Acharya Institute of Graduate Studies Department of Computer Application
Computer Assembly and Repair Lab 5
External Network card
Processor Cooling Fans
 CPU coolers are designed to dissipate heat produced by the processor that sits at the 
heart of your PC.
 The fans, radiators, and other elements in these cooling components allow for the 
accumulated heat energy to flow away from vital working parts without damaging the 
hardware.
Acharya Institute of Graduate Studies Department of Computer Application
Computer Assembly and Repair Lab 6
PCI-card (Peripheral Component Interconnect)
 Peripheral Component Interconnect is a common connection interface for attaching 
computer peripherals to the Mother Board. 
 PCI is most often used to connect Sound card, Network card, Vedio card.
HDD(Hard Disk Drive)
 A hard drive or hard disk drive (HDD) is a type of data storage device that is used in 
laptops and desktop computers.
 An HDD is a “non-volatile” storage drive, which means it can retain the stored data even 
when no power is supplied to the device. 
 Operating systems (OS) tell the HDD to read and write data as needed by programs. 
 The speed that the drive reads and writes this data is solely dependent on the drive itself.

PROGRAM NO -2
OBJECTIVE:
Demonstration of various ports: CPU , VGA port, PS/2 (keyboard, mouse) ,USB, LAN, 
Speaker, Audio.
DESCRIPTION: 
VGA Port:
 VGA ports also known as Video Graphic Array connector are those which connect the 
monitor to a computer’s video card. 
 VGA port has 15 holes and it is similar to the serial port connector. 
 But VGA Ports have holes in it and the serial port connector has pins in it.
PS/2 Port:
 PS/2 ports are special ports used for connecting old computer keyboard and mouse.
 It was invented by IBM. 
 In old computers, there are minimum of two PS/2 Ports, each for the keyboard and the 
mouse.
 It is a 6 pin mini Din connector.
Acharya Institute of Graduate Studies Department of Computer Application
Computer Assembly and Repair Lab 8
USB (Universal Serial Bus):
 In 1997 USB was first introduced. 
 This can connect all kinds of external USB devices, like external hard disk, printer, 
scanner, mouse, keyboard, etc. 
 There are minimum of two USB Ports provided in most of the computer systems.
 It is a kind of new type serial connection Port that is much faster than the old serial Ports 
and These USB Ports are much smarter and more versatile, as it allows the “daisy 
chaining” of up to 127 USB peripherals connected to one port. 
 The data transfer rate in this is Data12 megabits per second. It also provides plug & plays 
communication.
LAN Port
 A LAN port is also known as an Ethernet port. 
 Both terms refer to exactly the same socket on computers, servers, modems, Wi-Fi 
routers, switches, and other network devices.
Acharya Institute of Graduate Studies Department of Computer Application
Computer Assembly and Repair Lab 9
Speaker / Audio Port
 The CPU on the desktop computer will contain two 3.5 mm jack ports at the 
front. One of them is for getting audio signals (for speakers) and the other is for 
giving audio input (microphone). 
 You can find the difference between CPU and motherboard here. 
 So these two ports are used for basic purposes.
